        <h2>A brief summary of Bhagavad Gita</h2>
        <p>
            The Bhagavad Gita is one of the holy books of Hinduism.It was composed about two thousand years ago as part of the Mahabharata. It has teachings said to be given by Lord Sri Krishna who is the Supreme God. In the book (Bhagvat Gita), Krishna is talking to Arjuna, an Archer, before the kurukshetra war begins. Krishna tells Arjuna that he must perform his duty (called dharma) and go to fight. Arjuna hesitates because he is fighting his family, but in the end he listens to Krishna. He will not be led into the underworld for ever for his sins because he will not be reincarnated through Moksha.

        <h3>Lesson 1</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>We all have our dharma to fulfill if we want to know joy and peace.</strong><br> Everyone has a dharma to fulfill. This powerful concept lies at the foundation of our happiness as humans and points towards what we should be striving for. Therefore, doing more of what makes us happy and facing our demons, paint points, or however you want to call them is the key to a fulfilled life.
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson 2</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>Work on your temperament and enjoy the journey.</strong><br>Instead of always anticipating, it’s crucial to find joy in the journey. Ups and downs are life lessons, daily activities give you meaning and substance, and achieving smaller objectives prepares you for the end victory. True wisdom lies in finding happiness right here right now, not just for a brief moment in the accomplished future.

        <h3>Lesson 3</h3>
        <p>
            <strong>To meditate is to learn how to control your mind.</strong><br>Controlling your mind to stop producing negative thoughts and training yourself to focus attention on what matters most is a powerful practice. Moreover, by studying the common points of all religions and beliefs, you’ll notice how all of them advise mastering yourself and developing your character.
        </p>
        <h3>Lesson 4</h3>
        <p>
            <strong> Nourish your devotion</strong><br>Krishna begins the fourth chapter by describing the history of the knowledge he is sharing with Arjuna. At the dawn of creation, Krishna gave this imperishable knowledge to the sun-god Vivasvan, who gave it to the progenitor of humanity Manu, who in turn gave it to the illustrious king Ikshvaku
